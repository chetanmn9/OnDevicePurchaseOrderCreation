This App allows users to create purchase orders on their devices.  This app can be used on site where a contractor can generate a purchase order, assign a desired supplier and add the required items. Once the purchase order is created it can be uploaded to a MySQL database for further admin work by other stakeholders.

* Core Data Database is used for storing purchase orders, Items in a purchase order, item pricing and supplier information.
*	Purchase order and items added in purchase order are maintained as two different entities with one-to-many relationship.
*	All purchase orders are displayed as a table view â€“ with PO number, supplier name and PO created date available at a glance.
*	A php script is called to upload the purchase order to the MySQL Database.
*	Once a purchase order is uploaded, user gets a confirmation notification and the upload button is disabled. Upload status is displayed for each PO.
